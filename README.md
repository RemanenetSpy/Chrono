# Chronos: Time Capsule Social

> "Capturing the fragments of today for the clarity of tomorrow."

**Chronos** is a minimalist digital sanctuary designed for intentional reflection. It allows you to compose letters and attach "visual echoes" (photos) to be delivered to your future self. By locking memories behind a temporal gate, Chronos transforms social posting into a private ritual of mindfulness.

## 📜 The Purpose

In an era of instant gratification and ephemeral content, Chronos asks you to slow down. The purpose of this project is to create a space where thoughts can mature. Whether it's a message of encouragement for a difficult week ahead, a photo of a fleeting moment you want to revisit in a year, or a "moon"-long commitment to a goal, Chronos ensures your message arrives exactly when it's meant to.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Compose Across Time**: Write rich, serif-styled letters to the future.
- **Visual Echoes**: Attach images to your capsules to ground your memories in reality.
- **Temporal Gates**: Choose your horizon—from a single "Moon" (30 days) to a full "Decade."
- **The Vault**: A curated gallery of your pending and revealed history, styled as an elegant stationery collection.
- **Reflections**: Once a capsule is revealed, add a modern perspective to your past thoughts to see how much you've grown.
- **Privacy-First**: All data is stored locally in your chronicle (browser storage), ensuring your letters remain your own.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy: "Parchment & Ink"

Chronos moves away from the aggressive "tech" aesthetic of modern social media. It utilizes:
- **Warm Light Themes**: A parchment-inspired background (`#fdfbf7`) that is easy on the eyes and feels tactile.
- **Literary Typography**: The use of *EB Garamond* provides a classic, timeless feel for your most important thoughts.
- **Minimalist Animation**: Subtle "fade-up" transitions and fine-line borders that mimic high-quality stationery.
- **Atmospheric Depth**: A soft grain overlay to give the digital interface a physical, paper-like soul.

## 🛠️ Built With

- **React 19**: For a fluid, component-based composition.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For a bespoke, responsive utility-first design.
- **FontAwesome**: For delicate, minimalist iconography.
- **Google Fonts**: Specifically *EB Garamond* and *Inter*.
